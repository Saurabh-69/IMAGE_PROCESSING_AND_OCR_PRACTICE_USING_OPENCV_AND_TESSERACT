# Face Detection with OpenCV and Tesseract OCR 👤📸

## Overview
This project demonstrates face detection in images using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier and image processing techniques. The application reads multiple images, resizes them, converts them to grayscale, and detects faces, highlighting them with rectangles. The aim is to showcase basic computer vision functionalities for detecting faces in various images. 🖥️✨

## Features
- **Image Resizing**: Resizes input images to a consistent size for uniform processing. 🔄
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts images to grayscale to simplify the face detection process. 🌈
- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Haar Cascade Classifier to detect and visualize faces in images. 🖊️
- **Multiple Images Support**: Processes and detects faces in several images sequentially. 📄

## Prerequisites
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Tesseract OCR (optional, not used in this part)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy pytesseract
